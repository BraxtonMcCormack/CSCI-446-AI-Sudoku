# CSCI-446-AI-Sudoku
This project explores various search algorithms to solve Sudoku puzzles of differing difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Evil). We implemented and compared the performance of the following algorithms: Simple Backtracking, Backtracking with Forward Checking, Backtracking with Arc Consistency, Simulated Annealing, and Genetic Algorithm.
